Our company was founded on the belief that autonomous drone technology is poised to redefine industries, from logistics and inspection to agriculture and public safety. While the potential is immense, the technical journey from concept to a robust, deployed system is complex.
We bridge the gap between concept and deployment—building intelligent, reliable, and scalable drone solutions through hands-on development and system architecture.

### Our Technical Focus

**Computer Vision & AI:**
- 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation
- Generative AI (diffusion & flow models)
- Real-time object detection and tracking
- Edge AI deployment and inference optimization

**Robotics & Autonomous Systems:**

We've led computer vision pipelines for cutting-edge projects including the Robofruit autonomous strawberry harvesting robot (ROS-based, patented picking head). Currently, we develop intelligent drone systems with PX4 offboard control, real-time CV processing, and multi-sensor integration (RGB, Depth, LiDAR).

**Innovation Areas:**

Our experience spans generative AI for synthetic data generation, 3D vision techniques, and specialized applications in medical imaging—from pancreatic cancer detection to cardiac anatomy analysis across multiple sensing modalities.

### Our Approach

We combine theoretical depth with practical deployment experience, delivering solutions that work on resource-constrained hardware in real-world conditions.

**Robofruit:** Developed a modular robotic system addressing the complexity of harvesting strawberries in dense clusters. The system features a patented 2.5-DOF picking head that removes occlusions while harvesting without bruising fruit. Our novel perception pipeline detects strawberries and ripeness with 95% accuracy. Field trials across three strawberry varieties achieved 87% harvest rates and 83% success on pluckable fruit. The system was showcased at COP26 and demonstrates the viability of intelligent selective harvesting in real commercial growing conditions.
